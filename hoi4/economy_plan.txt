        Economic Law
        Stability
        Total

    Construction Speed
        Economic Law
        Construction Tech
        Conscription Law

    Production Cap
        Technology
        Focus Tree
    Factory Output
        Technology
        Focus Tree
        Stability
    Resources
        Need to test out precisely how it works.
